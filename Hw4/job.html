        face of JavaJam. They are an important part of our customers days, and
        experts in handcrafting delicious, perfect beverages. Baristas
        personally connect and create moments that make a difference and work
        together to create a welcoming store environment. They bring our mission
        and values to life—for our customers and each other—while proudly
        wearing the JavaJam apron. <strong>JavaJam Store Manager</strong
        ><br />Store Managers run their store as if it belongs to them—from
        managing daily operations to taking responsibility for financial
        results. Our managers are front-of-house leaders, spending time on the
        floor to connect with partners, customers, coach in the moment and
        identify ways to drive results. The role provides the opportunity to
        develop your own team, hiring and welcoming new partners and future
        leaders for your store.
